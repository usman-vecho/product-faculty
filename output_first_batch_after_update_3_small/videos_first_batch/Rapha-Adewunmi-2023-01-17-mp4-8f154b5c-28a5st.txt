Product Management: A Journey of Learning and Growth

In the fast-paced world of technology, the role of a product manager is crucial in ensuring the success of a product or service. However, unlike other professions in the industry, there is no clear-cut path to becoming a product manager. Each individual's journey is unique and often involves a mix of technical skills, domain expertise, and a strong understanding of customer needs. In this blog post, we will explore a conversation between two product managers and delve into the challenges they face, the skills they need to acquire, and the strategies they employ to deliver successful products.

The conversation begins with a simple exchange of greetings and an introduction of the speakers. Speaker 1, Adam Wubi, shares that he is a technical product manager at Bell, one of the leading telecom companies in Canada. He explains that his team focuses on speech-related products, such as a model that predicts the reason why a customer is calling to cancel based on their speech. This model enables Bell to offer customized solutions to retain customers. Adam seeks advice from Speaker 2, a more experienced product manager, on how to effectively communicate the usefulness of their products to stakeholders.

Speaker 2 starts by emphasizing that the journey to becoming a product manager is far from linear. Unlike other roles in the industry, there is no set path or degree specifically for product management. Product managers often come from various backgrounds, such as design, business analysis, or software development. Speaker 2 shares their own experience as an electrical engineer who transitioned into product management, highlighting the importance of constantly learning and adapting to new roles and industries.

As the conversation progresses, Speaker 2 explains the different stages of a product manager's career, from junior to senior roles. At each stage, the skills required change dramatically. Junior product managers focus on execution and organization, while senior product managers shift towards stakeholder management and holistic thinking. Directors and CPOs then deal with strategy and company-level decisions. Speaker 2 emphasizes the need to be adaptable and continuously reinvent oneself throughout the career.

Returning to Adam's initial question about effectively communicating the usefulness of products to stakeholders, Speaker 2 suggests that understanding customer needs and priorities is essential. By proactively aligning with stakeholders and knowing their constraints, product managers can better define priorities, set realistic expectations, and plan accordingly. Speaker 2 recommends using OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) as a framework for cross-functional collaboration and alignment.

Adam shares the challenges he faces in getting stakeholders to prioritize the integration of their products. He wonders if it's a lack of understanding or if other priorities take precedence. Speaker 2 suggests several approaches to address this issue. First, Adam should interview stakeholders to clearly understand their needs and how the product fits into their priorities. If stakeholders don't see the value or underestimate the resources required, it's essential to engage in sales-like discussions to explain the benefits and clarify the effort involved. Finally, if all else fails, offering resources to help with the integration may be necessary.

In conclusion, the conversation between the two product managers highlights the diverse paths and challenges faced by those in the product management field. It emphasizes the importance of continuously learning and adapting to new roles and industries. Effective communication, alignment of priorities, and proactive collaboration with stakeholders are key to successfully delivering valuable products. Although there may not be a specific degree or set career path for product managers, there are resources available, such as books and podcasts, that can provide valuable insights into the world of product management.

The conversation between Adam and Speaker 2 serves as a valuable guide for aspiring and current product managers, providing practical advice and sharing real-life experiences. It encourages product managers to embrace the ever-changing nature of their roles and the need for continuous learning and growth. By understanding customer needs, effectively communicating value, and building strong partnerships with stakeholders, product managers can navigate the complexities of their roles and deliver successful products that meet customer expectations.
