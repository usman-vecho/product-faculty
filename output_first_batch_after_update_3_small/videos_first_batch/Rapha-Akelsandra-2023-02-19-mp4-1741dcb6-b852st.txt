Introduction (200 words)

In this blog post, we will delve into a conversation between two individuals discussing various topics ranging from personal greetings to job search strategies and product strategy meetings. This conversation provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by job seekers and the importance of effective stakeholder management in product strategy.

Job Search Challenges and Strategies (600 words)

The conversation begins with one individual expressing their frustration with the job search process, specifically within the field of AI. The lack of job interviews and limited opportunities for AI-related positions is a growing concern. However, the other individual raises the point that building an online presence and creating high-quality content takes time and may not lead to immediate job offers. While building an online profile can be beneficial in the long run, it is important to align expectations and focus on traditional job application methods, such as networking and applying with a strong CV.

The conversation highlights the need for volume and persistence in job applications during challenging periods, such as the current job market. Moreover, the importance of understanding the different possibilities within the AI domain and being open to various product management roles is emphasized. The significance of leveraging personal networks, LinkedIn, and headhunters in the job search process is also highlighted, offering alternative approaches to finding job opportunities.

Product Strategy and Stakeholder Management (800 words)

Moving on from the job search discussion, the conversation transitions to product strategy and stakeholder management. The importance of identifying key stakeholders in an organization is emphasized. These stakeholders, typically two to four influential individuals, hold the power to drive or obstruct progress. Prioritizing these stakeholders and securing their buy-in before any official meetings occur is crucial.

The conversation stresses the value of conducting one-on-one meetings with stakeholders to gain their feedback and ensure alignment. These meetings serve as a preview of the larger strategy meetings, allowing for refinement and adjustment based on stakeholder input. By prioritizing these influential individuals, product managers can navigate the review process more efficiently and increase the likelihood of achieving stakeholder agreement.

Understanding North Star Metrics (400 words)

Another relevant topic addressed in the conversation is the concept of North Star metrics. The conversation highlights that a North Star metric should focus on expressing value rather than merely contributing to value. By choosing a relevant North Star metric, product managers can easily determine if they are moving in the right direction to deliver value to users. However, it is important to note that North Star metrics should be supported by other metrics that contribute to value. These additional metrics help identify the levers that can be pulled to drive value creation within a product.

Conclusion (200 words)

The conversation we analyzed provides valuable insights into the job search process, the importance of stakeholder management, and the relevance of North Star metrics in product strategy. It serves as a reminder that job seekers should align their expectations, leverage traditional application methods, and focus on building a strong network. Effective stakeholder management is crucial in product strategy, with an emphasis on prioritizing key stakeholders and obtaining their agreement early in the process. Finally, the conversation sheds light on the significance of choosing the right North Star metric and supporting metrics to drive value creation within a product.

Overall, this conversation offers practical advice for both job seekers and product managers, emphasizing the importance of perseverance, strategic networking, and a clear understanding of key metrics in achieving success.
