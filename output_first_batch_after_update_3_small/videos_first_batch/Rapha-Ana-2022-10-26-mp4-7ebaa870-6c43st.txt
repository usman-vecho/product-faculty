The Importance of North Star Metrics in Product Management

In the world of product management, the term "North Star" often comes up in discussions about strategy and goal setting. But what exactly is a North Star and why is it important for companies to have one? This blog post will delve into the conversation between two product managers and explore the significance of North Star metrics in guiding a company's product development efforts.

The conversation begins with an introduction and a request to discuss North Star metrics and how to select them for the company. The first product manager encourages the other to provide some background information about the company, its product, and its organizational structure. This information is vital in understanding the context in which the conversation about North Star metrics is taking place.

The second product manager explains that they work for LearnUpon, a learning management system (LMS) company that offers a SaaS product serving various customer segments. The company has experienced significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the nature of its tool. With expansion into larger enterprise segments, the product team is focused on catching up with competitors and identifying areas where the product can improve and differentiate itself.

One notable aspect of LearnUpon's organizational structure is the influence of the sales team. The CEO has a background in sales and still holds a significant role in driving the company's direction. The product team acknowledges that they are, in fact, a sales-driven company, as their main focus is on serving the sales team's needs rather than individual customer requirements.

The lack of a North Star metric becomes a central issue for the product team. While LearnUpon is a SaaS company, they are not currently leveraging data and product analytics to drive decision-making. The data team is relatively new, indicating that it will take time to establish a robust data infrastructure. In the meantime, the product team relies on insights from the sales team and customer feedback to prioritize features and enhancements.

The first product manager emphasizes the importance of having a North Star metric, even without access to detailed data. A North Star provides alignment and clarity across the organization, helping teams understand what they should prioritize and what outcomes they should strive for. He suggests that it's possible to create a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) graph based on assumptions and prior knowledge, which can serve as a starting point until more accurate data becomes available.

The conversation moves on to discussing the process of feature prioritization at LearnUpon. The second product manager explains that input comes from various sources, including sales, customer experience (CX), and the founders. While each product manager is responsible for prioritizing their own features, there are instances where sales-driven demands and founder input can push certain items to the front of the line.

The organizational structure of the product team at LearnUpon is also discussed. There are three segments within the team, focusing on learners, administrators, and partnerships/integrations. However, the second product manager clarifies that they are a principal product manager in the learner segment and do not have any product managers reporting to them.

The conversation then turns to the overall strategy of the company. The second product manager admits to having limited knowledge of the company's strategy beyond the annual goals focused on revenue. The first product manager emphasizes the importance of having clear goals and aims to differentiate between goals and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). While goals are specific targets to hit, OKRs are aspirational and encourage risk-taking and transformative thinking.

The importance of data in product management is highlighted once again. The second product manager explains that LearnUpon is in the process of building a data team and a product analytics tool. This indicates a commitment to becoming more data-driven in the future, but it will take time to establish these capabilities fully.

The first product manager acknowledges the difficulty of bringing about organizational change but suggests that starting with the product team is a good first step. He emphasizes the importance of having OKRs and a KPI graph to align the team and enable them to measure progress effectively. While the road to implementing these changes may be challenging, it is crucial to lead by example and showcase the benefits of data-driven decision-making.

In conclusion, the conversation between the two product managers shed light on the significance of North Star metrics in product management. A North Star metric provides a guiding light for product teams, aligning their efforts towards a common goal. Data may not always be readily available, but it is still possible to create a KPI graph based on assumptions and prior knowledge. By establishing clear goals and embracing data-driven decision-making, companies can set themselves up for success in the highly competitive world of product development.
