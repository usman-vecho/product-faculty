In today's increasingly competitive market, companies are constantly looking for ways to stay ahead of their competitors. This often involves launching new features and products to attract more clients and generate growth. However, what happens when these promises lead to problems within the organization?

In a recent conversation between two professionals, the issue of overpromising and underdelivering was discussed. Speaker 1, representing a software company called Mortgage Automator, shared the company's struggle with its fast expansion and the negative consequences it had on their product development and market research process. The company's partners, who are also the founders, had oversold their products and features, leading the development team to work on projects without sufficient research or testing. This resulted in ongoing bugs and glitches in their products and a lack of integration with existing features. As a product manager, Speaker 1 was concerned about finding a balance between launching new features to attract bigger clients and fixing the existing issues.

Speaker 2, an experienced professional in the field, acknowledged the complexity of the situation and offered some insight into how to address the problem. They emphasized the need to prioritize fixing the current mess caused by technical debt. Technical debt refers to the accumulation of unresolved technical issues in a product or software system. It not only slows down development but also affects the overall efficiency and reliability of the product. Speaker 2 advised Speaker 1 to assess the business impact of the technical debt and prioritize the problems to be solved. By focusing on the business outcomes and impact, Speaker 1 could emphasize the urgency and importance of resolving these issues to the founders and stakeholders.

However, Speaker 2 also cautioned about the never-ending nature of technical debt and advised Speaker 1 to clearly define the success metrics and exit criteria for fixing the technical debt. Without clear objectives and measures, technical debt can become an ongoing and never-ending process, hindering progress and growth. By clearly defining the desired outcomes, such as reducing development time or improving reliability, Speaker 1 could communicate the importance of addressing these issues and the potential benefits to the business.

Moreover, Speaker 2 highlighted the need for a shift in the company's process. Currently, the founders determine what needs to be done, and the product managers and developers work backwards to fulfill these requirements. This approach is counterproductive and leads to a lack of proper research and planning. Speaker 2 suggested that Speaker 1 initiate a discussion on implementing healthier processes in the company, such as using squads or product teams with shared objectives and accountability.

One significant challenge in addressing this problem is managing customer expectations. Speaker 2 acknowledged the need for a roadmap and commitments to customers in the B2B (business-to-business) market. Balancing these commitments with the need to fix technical debt and prioritize development can be a delicate task. Speaker 1 expressed concerns about slowing down growth and revenue, but Speaker 2 highlighted the long-term benefits of resolving technical debt, such as reducing costs and improving the company's overall prospects.

It was also important to consider the influence and authority Speaker 1 had within the company. Speaker 1 had the ability to report to both the head of product management and the founders. This meant Speaker 1 had the opportunity to influence and drive changes within the organization. By presenting a well-researched and data-driven case to the founders, Speaker 1 could make a compelling argument for prioritizing the resolution of technical debt and implementing healthier processes.

In conclusion, the conversation between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 shed light on the challenges faced by Mortgage Automator and the importance of addressing technical debt and implementing healthy product development processes. Speaker 2 offered valuable insights into how to communicate the business impact of technical debt and prioritize its resolution. Speaker 1 was encouraged to take a business-oriented approach, clearly define success metrics, and initiate discussions on process improvements. By effectively managing customer expectations and having the authority to influence change within the company, Speaker 1 had the potential to steer Mortgage Automator towards long-term success.
