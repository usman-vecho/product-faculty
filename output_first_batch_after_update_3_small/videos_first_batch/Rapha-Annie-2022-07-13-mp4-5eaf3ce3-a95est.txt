Developing a Healthy Process and Sharing Knowledge in the Company

In a recent conversation, a pressing issue was brought up regarding the lack of knowledge and information sharing across the company and its teams. This concern was particularly bothering the speaker and several others. Examples were given, such as the support team lacking context about new features being rolled out and having to learn on the fly. The product team also faced challenges due to a lack of market and industry knowledge, leading to a limited understanding of use cases. While the company provided seminars on industries and markets, they were deemed insufficient for feature development.

To address the knowledge and information sharing gaps, the conversation introduced the concept of having one support person in every product team. This would ensure alignment between support and product teams, as well as provide valuable input from the support team during the prioritization and planning of features. It was suggested that the support person should be an individual contributor who specializes in the specific matter being discussed.

However, it was acknowledged that relying solely on one person, such as the head of the product team, to provide training and answer questions was not feasible. Therefore, the speaker sought suggestions on how to help the head of the product team diversify responsibilities and share knowledge with the rest of the team.

The conversation then shifted towards the importance of developing a shared worldview and the role it plays in knowledge sharing. The speaker advocated for a continuous learning process that involved reading, talking to users and customers, and analyzing data. These three aspects were considered crucial in building domain expertise and understanding the product.

The speaker also introduced the concept of a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) graph, which could serve as a framework for aligning everyone on the organization's worldview. This graph would illustrate how different metrics are interconnected and provide a context for decision-making. It was emphasized that the accuracy of the worldview was not as important as having a shared understanding and being able to adapt and refine it over time.

To address the specific challenge of developers lacking knowledge about core features and their connections, the speaker suggested engaging in a brainstorming process involving all team members. This process would start with product, gather feedback from stakeholders, and iterate until a shared worldview was established. The speaker acknowledged that not everyone needed to be involved at once but stressed the importance of everyone feeling heard and having an impact on the process.

It was noted that while implementing these suggestions would not provide an instant solution, they could serve as a useful basis for improving knowledge sharing and alignment within the company. The KPI graph and shared worldview would aid in decision-making and ensure that everyone understood the overall strategy and goals.

In conclusion, developing a healthy process for information sharing and knowledge exchange is vital for a company's success. By implementing the suggested approaches, such as having one support person in each team and creating a shared worldview through the KPI graph, companies can address the challenges of lack of context and knowledge gaps. Emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and incorporating feedback from all stakeholders can contribute to a more inclusive and productive work environment.
