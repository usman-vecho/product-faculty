In the fast-paced world of digital communication, scheduling meetings can often be a cumbersome task. With people spread across different time zones and using various calendar platforms, it can be challenging to find a time that works for everyone. But what if there was a solution that could streamline this process and make scheduling meetings a breeze? This is the problem that Arthur, a product manager, is trying to solve with his new business idea.

Arthur is currently working at a company that provides simultaneous interpretation services. However, he is also working on the side to develop a product called Kudo, which aims to create a global calendar that allows users to see everyone's availability in one place. This is similar to the functionality available within a company's Outlook calendar, but on a much larger scale that includes people from different organizations and calendar platforms.

The conversation between Arthur and an acquaintance, who we'll call Speaker 1, revolves around the challenges Arthur is facing with prioritizing features for Kudo and how he plans to validate his business idea. Speaker 1 provides valuable insights and advice, helping Arthur narrow down his focus and identify the riskiest hypotheses to test.

One of the riskiest hypotheses Arthur is trying to validate is whether there is a demand for a product like Kudo. He believes that there is value in being able to see someone else's calendar availability, but he is unsure if this value is compelling enough for people to use and pay for the product. Speaker 1 agrees that the underlying hypothesis about the product's value is less risky and doesn't need to be tested extensively. Instead, the focus should be on testing the hypothesis related to the cost of customer acquisition and distribution.

Speaker 1 explains that Arthur needs to prioritize building a network effect or viral growth for Kudo. This means ensuring that the more users join the platform, the lower the cost of acquiring new customers becomes. Speaker 1 suggests creating a flow where users are encouraged to connect their calendars and invite others to join, triggering a network effect. The goal is to achieve a high K factor, which measures the number of users activated by each new user. The higher the K factor, the more exponential the growth of the platform.

Arthur recognizes the importance of achieving viral growth and mentions that he is already working on incorporating viral elements into the product. He plans to softly encourage users to invite others to join by requesting access to their availability when trying to schedule a meeting. This strategy aims to leverage the concept of "good citizenship," where users feel compelled to register so that others can easily schedule meetings. Additionally, Arthur is exploring ways to make the onboarding process seamless and user-friendly to increase conversion rates.

One of the main concerns Arthur raises is the potential competition from larger companies like Google. However, Speaker 1 reassures him that competition from big companies is not as significant of a threat as it may seem. He explains that these companies often have bureaucratic processes, making it difficult for them to quickly develop and launch new products. Additionally, Arthur has the advantage of being able to target a specific niche or use case that the larger companies may overlook.

Ultimately, Speaker 1 advises Arthur to focus on validating the riskiest hypotheses related to customer acquisition and network effects. This involves testing different messaging and strategies to encourage user activation and create a high K factor. By prioritizing these aspects, Arthur can ensure that his product gains traction and attracts a growing user base.

The conversation between Arthur and Speaker 1 showcases the importance of prioritization and hypothesis testing in the early stages of a startup. It also highlights the need to focus on the riskiest assumptions and validate them through experimentation. By following lean startup principles and continuously iterating based on user feedback, Arthur has a better chance of building a successful product that solves a real pain point for users.

As Arthur continues to develop Kudo and gather user feedback, he plans to incorporate the insights gained from this conversation. With a clear roadmap and a focus on viral growth, he is well on his way to creating a valuable tool that simplifies the process of scheduling meetings across different calendars and time zones.
